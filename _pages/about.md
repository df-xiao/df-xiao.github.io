Hello, there!

I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of EEOT](https://eoe.njust.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](http://www.njust.edu.cn/). My research interest includes federated learning(FL), machine learning, and block chain.

I'm very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Long Shi](http://gsmis.njust.edu.cn/open/TutorInfo.aspx?dsbh=rQJPu5GH3OmKp6iR5KIt6A==&yxsh=9T4MAi3dYTw=&zydm=viKQs5wumiA=) of [School of EEOT](https://eoe.njust.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](http://www.njust.edu.cn/). I'm currently conducting research training on the combination of federated learning, differential privacy, and blockchain.

You can find my CV here: [Zhou Xiaoyue's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

P.S. I've also created a personal blog for myself where I share my study notes, which can be accessed here: [Personal Blog](https://blog.xiaoyuezhou.top)
